## üßê Overview

Originally, Salesforce was the primary CRM system. However, as a small nonprofit, the organization faced challenges with Salesforce's complexity and cost. To empower non-technical team members and enable more visual, collaborative workflows‚Äîespecially for Business Development‚Äîthe operational layer was migrated to Monday.com. It provided a more intuitive UI, flexible board-based structure, and better support for managing BD pipelines across stages (e.g., Follow-up ‚Üí Quote ‚Üí MOU).

Salesforce continues to be used as the primary backend data store, with only a minimal number of user licenses retained for API-based syncing and legacy data access.

To enable this transition and maintain system consistency, this project implemented:

Real-time Sync from Monday ‚Üí Salesforce (Webhook-triggered via AWS Lambda), to reflect changes made by operations teams back into Salesforce.

One-time Migration from Salesforce ‚Üí Monday (scheduled batch via GitHub Actions + GraphQL), to backfill initial data.

During this process, the project handled numerous field-level and structural mismatches between the two systems, carefully mapping and transforming data across platforms.

>üí° This real-time synchronization between Monday and Salesforce is difficult to implement even with a paid Monday Enterprise plan, and typically requires costly third-party integrations. By building the full system in-house through custom code, this project saved the organization an estimated **$7,000‚Äì$18,000** annually, while delivering reliable automation tailored to their exact business logic. It also eliminated the need for manual data entry across platforms, freeing up valuable time for the operations team and reducing human error. This represents **a major cost-saving achievement for a nonprofit organization**, where budget efficiency is especially critical.

## Part I: Initial Migration (Salesforce ‚Üí Monday.com)
### Batch Workflow
1. GitHub Actions schedules a weekly run.

2. Python script authenticates via OAuth and fetches Salesforce data.

3. Custom schema mapping adapts records for Monday GraphQL.

4. Batched GraphQL mutations write to Monday.com boards.

5. Execution details logged in PostgreSQL for auditability.

---


## üì¶ Part II: Real-Time Synchronization (Monday.com ‚Üí Salesforce)
### Event Pipeline
1. Monday webhook fires on item update, rename, creation, or deletion.

2. Payload hits AWS API Gateway and is routed to Lambda.

3. Lambda parses event type and dispatches accordingly.

4. Business logic resolves data transformation and API invocation.

4. Salesforce objects (Lead/Account/Contact/Opportunity) are updated.

5. PostgreSQL logs event metadata and response status.

6. Telegram sends alerts for critical failures.
